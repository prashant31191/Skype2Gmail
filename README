Skype2Gmail is a simple application that can be used to send your
skype chat messages to gmail or save it in your local disk as plain
text messages.

Right now, there's an alpha version available in the Downloads
sections, which can be used from the command line. The usage is very
simple, just make sure skype is running before running one of the
following commands:

- java -jar skype2gmail-1.0.jar --mail

Will send all your messages to your e-mail account. When you run it
for the first time, it will ask for your credentials and will save
them (if you allow) in a configuration file in your home directory.

Chat dates will be preserved as the mail "sent date", so all your
chats will be sorted accordingly.

- java -jar skype2gmail-1.0.jar --disk

Will write all your messages in your home directory, under the
.skype2gmail/history directory. Doing so, you can easly use any sort
of tools to search through the text messages, for example, to locate
that piece of information someone told you, but you forgot.

Chat dates will be preserved as the file "modification date", so
you'll be to use any sort of tool that allows you to list the files 
based on the modification date.

There's still some work to do! I have the following features planned:

- allow the application to keep running and synchronizing your chats
periodically
- create a .deb package and a windows installer do easy installation
- deploy the project in a launchpad PPA, allowing anyone to install it
using apt-get
- look into the user's gmail contact list to figure the skype user's
  mail address, so the application can automatically put their mail
  addresses in the senders and recipients fields
- create java web start file to allow starting the application
  directly from the web and helping the users keep it as up-to-date as
  possible
  
Please, try and let me know what you think, report bugs and feel free
to make suggestions!

See ya!
